## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

W3 Schools 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Some issues I ran into was that the code didn’t work because there was duplicate code. This type of error didn’t have red lines so it was difficult to locate where the issue was coming from at first. Another challenge was coming up with my own function for the guessing portion without a solid grasp of how the javascript code worked in the program. It was particularly difficult for me because since most of the javascript code was given to us, it was hard to understand how we arrived at that exact solution, especially without a foundation of how the structures worked. Nonetheless, it was still fun to practice and try different things even though I couldn't get my own attempt at the code to completely work. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

It’s really interesting how CSS, HTML, and JavaScript work together to perform the functionalities of web development. That said, there are a lot of questions that I have about the languages in general, but these questions are specific from the pre-work. To begin with CSS, how are certain colors (e.g. yellow, blue) stored in the language but for more colors, there is a color code, or a specific memory address? And are all classes in the CSS file called by adding a period before the class name (ex: .hidden)? Why are some HTML tags left open (e.g. meta and link)? In other words, why are the tags not followed with a </> like the other tags? The link tag is also really interesting and I’d like to understand what href and ref do to import links. Are there also limits to how small the format of the text can be? (h1 tags) Consequently, are there different sizes of paragraph styles? As for JavaScript, a more concrete understanding of how functions work and what kind of structures can be called (from HTML and CSS) would be helpful to my understanding of the language. Otherwise, this was a fun experience because the languages seem fairly simple stylistically which is why I hope to have a fun yet challenging experience. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours, I’d be interested in implementing more of the optional functions but I would work on adding more stylistic behaviors as well. The Title and the Start button could have its own page before the user can interact with the buttons. Once Start is pressed, the screen will switch to the buttons with the rules and optional features such as tracking guesses and a ticking clock which would make the game look more sophisticated. Some ways that the game could be more complex is if there were levels to the game. For every game won, another button will be added along with the secret pattern so that it becomes more difficult. A point system would therefore be implemented as well for every game won and a High Score board feature could be included to track the user’s highest score.

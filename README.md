2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

It was challenging to come up with my own function for the game function without a solid grasp of how javascript worked. Nonetheless, it was still fun to practice and try different things even though I couldn't get it to completely work. For instance, I wasn't sure how to display a message to the user if they won or lost which the alert and console.log structures performed in the answer template.
